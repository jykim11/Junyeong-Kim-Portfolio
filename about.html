   <h1> About Myself </h1>
      <p> My name is Junyeong Kim, but I prefer to be called by James. I am a transfer student from Wake Technical Community College, and my major is Computer Science with the intent to go for Software Engineering or AI Engineering. I really enjoy learning about coding and Artificial Intelligence because it seems extremely interesting how everything can be developed with codes and algorithms. I find it fascinating that everything can be built from scratch and developed into something we never imagined of.</p>
      <p>I worked on several projects consisting of Java and C++, and I am very excited to learn about CSS and HTML by building my own website! Although I am a transfer student, due to COVID-19, I have not had the chance to actually go to UNC Chapel Hill's campus and enjoy the atmosphere and its vibrant environment.</p>
