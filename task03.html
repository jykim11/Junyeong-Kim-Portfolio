    <h1> Task 03 : Document Markup </h1>
    <h3><u>TASK</u></h3>
    <p> Find an e-book on the Project Gutenberg website that is interesting to you. Your task is to transform, through
      skilful formatting, a basic text version of the book into one created to be capable of being saved as a file
      capable of being read on an e-reader. </p>

    <p>Retrieve the plain text version of the e-book from the Project Gutenberg site. Start with the main page and use
      the search tools on the site to find it. But how does one do this? </p>

    <p>If you were to be interested in the book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, you would navigate to its
      Gutenberg location and download the plain text version, in UTF-8 format, with no compression and a size of 212 KB,
      from the main site. Save the document on your client as a .txt file. Once you have the document on your client,
      open it in the program of your choice and save it in the program's file extension, so you can take advantage of
      some of the specific tools available in the program. </p>

    <h3><u>CONDITION</u></h3>
    <p> Since the world is changing and e-books are becoming a reality, prepare this task for a client who wants a
      product ready for loading onto an e-book reader. </p>

    <p>That means the notional paper size to be used is four inches wide by nine inches tall.</p>

    <p>Of course, you will want to include some white space margins around the text.
      If you wish to format your book for your e-reader, you may make the notional paper size fit your particular
      version. A friend's iPad, for example, has a 5.5 by 7.5 inch screen space.</p>


    <p>You may, if you choose to, do task 03 as a group project. These are some rules of thumb to follow for group work
      in INLS161.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you choose the team option, let your recitation instructor know who are the members of your team.</li>
      <li>Note who your work group members are and be sure you know them by face and by email address.</li>
      <li>As much as possible, every member of the group should do all the components of the task. Do not parcel out
        portions of the task to individuals.</li>
      <li>Then, when your team has completed the task, one member of the team will submit that team's task in the Task
        03 assignment space.</li>
    </ul>
